            <h3>Project 1: ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION USING HASHING </h3>
            <p><u>Description of Project 1.</u>
                It describes Encryption as the process by which a
                readable message is converted to an unreadable form to prevent unauthorized parties from reading it. Decryption is the
                process of converting an encrypted message back to its original(readable) format. Part of my job in this project was to develop
                XML code (a design part of this project)..

            <p><u>Description of Project 2.</u>
                It describes relying on retrospective data to identify the areas of high concentrations of crime and where 
                policing and other crime reduction resources should be deployed.
                Part of my job in this project was to develop an application for the project.
